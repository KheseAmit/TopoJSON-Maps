{"name":"TopoJSON-Maps","tagline":"A library of TopoJSON  maps for Geo-Mapping (Data Visualization) ","body":"### Welcome to TopoJSON-Maps\r\nThis project serves to help developers and students have easy access to TopoJSON formatted maps for Geo-Mapping. TopoJSON is substantially more compact than GeoJSON, which results in a faster load time and efficient rendering of the map.  \r\nPlease star (bookmark) this repository in your GitHub profile and/or fork (get a copy of) the repository to get all its content.  \r\n\r\nTo contribute, please scroll down to see `Instructions for Contributing`. \r\n\r\n### Downloading the TopoJSON Maps\r\nThere are several ways to download the .json files(maps) in the repository. \r\n \r\n* Click \"Download ZIP\" and extract the .zip file to view the contents from the latest master repository.  \r\n* Fork the repository and clone the repository locally.  \r\n* If you only want to download (a) specific file(s), then navigate your way through the repository, click on the file you want to download, and click on Raw. After clicking Raw, you should see the contents of the file in JSON format. Simply use Command-S (MAC) or CTRL-S (PC) to save the file. Make sure the extension of the file is .json and NOT .html.  \r\n\r\n### Looking for something specific? Request a Map\r\nIf your map is not available in the repository, then do not worry. Simply open an issue in the original repository maintained by @kthotav. Enter the title of what map you are looking for and a detailed description of the map or links to image examples of the map. You will be notified if your requested map has been uploaded to master repository.   \r\n\r\nAlternatively, if you do not have a GitHub account, then you may email the owner `kthotav@gmail.com` or connect via `Twitter:kthotav`.\r\n\r\n### Instructions for Contributing \r\nTo contribute a TopoJSON formatted map, fork the repository and clone it locally. Make your changes in the `Contributions` directory. Create a sub directory with your GitHub username in the `Contributions` directory. You may then include any .json files. Be sure to include a README.md to explain what exactly are the files you are adding. Please do not tamper with other contributors' directories or the files outside the `Contributions` directory. I will only merge the change or update the repository if necessary.  \r\n\r\nYour pull request will be denied if:  \r\n\r\n* You edit other files outside the `Contributions` directory or other directories of the contributors.   \r\n* You did not create sub directory under the `Contributions` directory with your GitHut `username`.  \r\n* You did not include a README.md with proper description*   \r\n* Your files are not TopoJSON format.  \r\n\r\n*Your pull request may also be denied for other miscellaneous reasons. If denied a pull request, then please try again or contact the owner* @kthotav.  \r\n\r\nIf you find a bug in other directories, then please report it by opening an issue in the owner's repository. \r\n\r\n### Contributors\r\n@kthotav - Owner  \r\n@sneeruga ","google":"","note":"Don't delete this file!
