# TopoJSON-Maps

### Welcome to TopoJSON-Maps
This project serves to help developers and students have easy access to TopoJSON formatted maps for Geo-Mapping. TopoJSON is substantially more compact than GeoJSON, which results in a faster load time and efficient rendering of the map.  
Please star (bookmark) this repository in your GitHub profile and/or fork (get a copy of) the repository to get all its content.  

To contribute, please scroll down to see `Instructions for Contributing`.

### Downloading the TopoJSON Maps
There are several ways to download the .json files(maps) in the repository.

* Click "Download ZIP" and extract the .zip file to view the contents from the latest master repository.  
* Fork the repository and clone the repository locally.  
* If you only want to download (a) specific file(s), then navigate your way through the repository, click on the file you want to download, and click on Raw. After clicking Raw, you should see the contents of the file in JSON format. Simply use Command-S (MAC) or CTRL-S (PC) to save the file. Make sure the extension of the file is .json and NOT .html.  

### Looking for something specific? Request a Map
If your map is not available in the repository, then do not worry. Simply open an issue in the original repository maintained by @kthotav. Enter the title of what map you are looking for and a detailed description of the map or links to image examples of the map. You will be notified if your requested map has been uploaded to master repository.

Alternatively, if you do not have a GitHub account, then you may email the owner `kthotav@gmail.com` or connect via `Twitter:kthotav`.
